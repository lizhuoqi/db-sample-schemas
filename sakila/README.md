### where does it come from

The sakila sample database is from [Sakila Sample Database Version 1.2][sakila sample database], its code [sakila-db.zip][sakila sample database source] .

> The Sakila sample database was initially developed by Mike Hillyer, a former member of the MySQL AB documentation team. It is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, and so forth. The The Sakila sample database also serves to highlight features of MySQL such as Views, Stored Procedures, and Triggers.
>
> Additional information on the Sakila sample database and its usage can be found through the MySQL forums.
>
> -- [Introduction][introduction]


### Differences from the original

* All 16 tables in sakila-schema.sql* are reserved
* Field data type adjustment, so that it can be used in postgres, sqlite3, mysql
* All data for sakila-data.sql*
* Data has been reordered randomly
* Views and functions have not been created yet

### Adjustments for postgres, sqlite3, mysql compatibility


| serial number | original script | postgres | sqlite3 | mysql
|-----|-------------------------------|------------ |---------|------
| 1 | smallint, tinyint | int2 | int2 | int2
| 2 | mediumint | int | int | int
| 3 | UNSIGNED | remove this keyword | remove this keyword | remove this keyword
| 4 | auto_increment | sequence | none | auto_increment
| 5 | default null for nullable fields | remove | remove | remove
| 6 | film.rating enum | `varchar` + `check(rating in ('G','PG','PG-13','R','NC-17')) ` | same as postgres | same as postgres
| 7 | film.release_year year | `int2` + `check(release_year >= 1901 and release_year <= 2155 )` | same as postgres | same as postgres
| 8 | film.special_features set | varchar | varchar | set
| 9 | staff.picture blob | bytea | blob | blob
| 10 | language.name char(20) | varchar(20) | varchar(20) | varchar(20)
| 11 | address.location GEOMETRY srid| to be done | to be done | to be done
| 12 | last_update, ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in each table | to be done | to be done | to be done
| 13 | film_text Full Text Search | to be done | to be done | to be done

<!-- todo timestamp with timezone -->

### Prerequisites

Prepare a postgres, sqlite, MySQL database service. How to install database services, see ["How to quickly set up a usable SQL environment"][lab]

In addition to sqlite, use postgres, MySQL, at least these permissions are required.

    SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE,
    CREATE, DROP, RELOAD, REFERENCES,
    INDEX, ALTER, SHOW DATABASES,
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES,
    LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, CREATE VIEW

Generally, if we use the local host for experiments, we use users with high privileges, and these privileges do not require you to pay special attention.

After installing the postgres and mysql databases, configure the *bin* directories of these database programs into the `PATH` of the environment.
sqlite is just an executable file that can be placed in any directory contained in the environment variable `PATH`.

### Install the sample database

1. Download this repository

2. Go to the repository directory on the command line

````
cd PATH_TO_DB_SAMPLE_SCHEMAS/sakila
````

3. Unzip the csv data file

````
unzip ./data/data.zip
````

4. Execute the SQL script according to the actual database service used to create tables and import sample data

In order to ensure that the SQL script can be executed repeatedly, the SQL script contains the `DROP` operation DDL of the view and table before executing the `create` operation. Please ignore the following error messages in the command line terminal. It's just telling you, "delete non-existent objects".

    Similar to "ERROR: Table 'sakila.store' doesn't exist"

On my personal laptop, the execution of the script completes in under 3 seconds.

    MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports
    Processor 2.3 GHz Dual Core Intel Core i5
    Memory 8 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3

#### Install in Postgres service


First, start your postgres database service instance
    
    pg_ctl -D [directory where your postgres example has been initialized] start

Execute on another command line terminal

    psql < import-pg.sql

If logged in to psql cli
  
    âžœ psql
    psql (14.2)
    Type "help" for help.
    
    macbook=#\i import-pg.sql

<details>
  <summary>Results</summary>

  The information printed by the command line terminal when executing the script is too long. The following uses `... ðŸ¥± ...` to replace some repeated information.
    
    ````
    ~/youwu.today/sqllab/sample/db-sample-schemas/sakila git:(develop)
    âžœ psql < import-pg.sql

#### Install in sqlite

Execute in command line terminal

    sqlite3 sakila.sqlite < import-sqlite.sql

If you are already at the sqlite3 prompt

    âžœ sqlite3 sakila.sqlite
    SQLite version 3.37.0 2021-12-09 01:34:53
    Enter ".help" for usage hints.
    sqlite > .read import-sqlite.sql


If the *sakila.sqlite* file does not exist, sqlite3 will automatically create it.
